# HardCourseWorkTwo
Educational project. 2nd year coursework
1. Implement another implementation for QuestionService, namely MathQuestionService.
 This service should work similarly to JavaQuestionService, but with mathematical examples.
2. Implement a MathQuestionController controller, which allows you to add, delete, and get a list of math questions.
  The @Qualifier annotation may be required to obtain a specific implementation of the QuestionService interface.
3. Transfer the function of storing questions from services to separate entities - repositories.
    To do this, you will need to implement the QuestionRepository interface with the add, remove and getAll methods. And then write two implementations for questions in Java and in mathematics.
